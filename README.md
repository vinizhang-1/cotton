# Cotton Leaf Disease Intelligent Diagnosis

This project provides an intelligent diagnosis framework for cotton leaf diseases based on an improved YOLO model and large language model integration.  

---

## Project Introduction
The image dataset used in this project contains **five categories of cotton leaf conditions**:  
- Early-stage Curly Leaf Disease  
- Mid-stage Curly Leaf Disease  
- Healthy  
- Root-knot Nematode Disease  
- White Mold Disease  

The model detects diseased areas on cotton leaves and provides corresponding control recommendations.  
By integrating an improved YOLO network with a fine-tuned large language model, this project achieves **accurate detection, intelligent diagnosis, and decision support** for cotton leaf diseases.
